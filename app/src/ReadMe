Lets do some design:

MainActivity triggers a view which is composed of list of receipes.

Clicking one of the recipie triggers recipeActivity

Recipe Activity is composed of two fragments
    - reicipe list
    - recipe step
While on two pane mode both fragments are shown side by side. When not, the clicking event in recipe list fragment opens recipe step fragment.
